Here is the life cycle of a game in a league :

1- Create it
Once created, a game has two teams, no score, and it is closed.
When it is closed, no one can bet for this game.

2- Open it
Once opened, users can bet for this game, trying to forecast the score.

3- Close it
Once closed, no one can bet for this game.
Probably the game is being played somewhere in Anfield Road, Geoffroy-Guichard, or Santiago Bernabeu.

4- Edit it, to set its score
When you know the exact score, you enter it and save the game.

5- Compute points
You can now compute the points won by each played that has bet for this game :
- 3 points for an exaxt score (you said Real Madrid would win 2-0 against Getafe and the exactly did)
- 1 point for a correct result (you said Monaco would win 1-0 versus Lyon, but exact score was 3-1 for Monaco)
- 0 point for a completely wrong result (you said Sampdoria would beat Internazionale 1-0 but there was a draw 1-1)

Once the points have been computed, the ranking of this league has probably been changed. 

### Admin participants

This page enables to administrate the participants of a league.
